  "Repro Steps": "Created by: Schenten, Kevin Category: PRB-520.11 Build: 8.1.3.1786 - WPM 8.1.3 Symptoms: Order of Bundles sometimes Fails. According to VPA and his analyzing in a remote session this is caused by a former fix. We try to get the ServiceName from the Web Service instead of the DB, but the data will not be returned if a service is not added to a catalog. Prerequisites: Bundle with Services that are not added to a catalog. Reproduction:   *  Add bundle to catalog  *  Service from Bundle shouldn't be added to Catalog (we shouldn't be able to order this service without bundle)  *  shop the bundle in portal  Result: Checkout of the shopping cart is not possible. Unable to get property 'length' of undefined or null reference General.js (54,3) Expected Result: Successfull shopping process."

  "Repro Steps": "Created by: Schenten, Kevin Category: PRB-520.00 Build: 8.1.2.1712 - WPM 8.1.2 Symptoms: Users can't logon to Service Store if there are two accounts in the same domain with identically UPN prefix but different suffixes, like ine the following example: testuser@support.lab and testuser@support.com  Security logs will throw such error: 2017-01-12 12:37:42,493 ERROR 8.1.3.1786 - Logon for username sup\\ppinkel from IP address: 10.65.160.218 failed, reason: \"Several matching database entries found.\". This leads to the conclusion, that we somehow take the users UPN and truncate it before the '@' symbol. At least, thats what I was told once before. This mechanism might better be reworked to either be able to use both, UPN or NT4Name to login or to use sAMAccountName for the login. Prerequisites: One Domain with 2+ Domain Suffixes. 2 Accounts with the same UPN prefix but different Suffixes. Reproduction:   *  try to login using the nt4name of one of those accounts.  Result: Login not possible. 2017-01-12 12:37:42,493 ERROR 8.1.3.1786 - Logon for username sup\\ppinkel from IP address: 10.65.160.218 failed, reason: \"Several matching database entries found.\". Expected Result: Matching the correct account to the used login data.  This case has been already discussed with Vadim and as result we created this problem."

  "Repro Steps": "Created by: B�nick, Matthias Category:  Build: 8.1.2.1712 - WPM 8.1.2 Symptoms: This problem is ony present when a partial import is done and the importsequence \"LDAP: Update deleted Computers\" is executed. When a computer will set to deleted by the import definition, the update objects activity \"Set active state\", which is executed after this import definition, set the computer state back to active, while the AD Account state keeps to be 3. This is because the filter statement is this: UserAccountControl & 2 <= 0 AND T(SPSAssetClassBase).ManagementType = 2  AND Domain = @Domain AND T(SPSCommonClassLdap).LastSyncDate = @LastSyncDate UserAccountControl wont be change, when an computer is set to deleted by the import definition. In my test the value was still 4128. And this will never return 1 in your \"UserAccountControl & 2\" statement. also T(SPSCommonClassLdap).LastSyncDate = @LastSyncDate is not a good thing, because the mentioned import sequence also updates this value. Prerequisites: LDAP: Update deleted computers must be executed > no full import! state values for active and deleted computers should be defined in ldap config Reproduction:   *  create new computer in AD  *  import  *  change the state to something which is not in used for active or deleted computers  *  import again  Result: Computer has the configured state for active Expected Result: Computer has the configured state for deleted"

MAS: After analysing the issue I saw that the definition for location and ou structures is totally crap. The 2 major conditions for defining the structure are: T(SPSCommonClassBase).Location.T(SPSLocationClassBase).ID and T(SPSCommonClassBase).Location.ID I would expect that this simple condition works T(SPSCommonClassBase).Location but the structure code has an error and shows no subnodes for this condition.

In general: Wwhat is happening there, every import reports many installations as updated, why? When a computer is not updated it makes not sense to apply changes to related installations. It looks like this is happening. Can we make this import faster by removing updates for installations, where the computer delivers no update? This topic can be reproduced in every lab.

  "Repro Steps": "Created by: Schenten, Kevin Category: Matrix42 Service Store 5.2 Build: 8.1.0.1637- WPM 8.1 Use case The Evaluation of the Primary MAC Address with SCCM Provider is basically quite random. After reviewing the query with VKH there is first of all a mistake in the query which leads to no row numbering as the screenshots Show. But even if this is fixed, the evaluation still makes no sense. It would be the case, that allways the network card with the highest IP (192.168.1.2 > 10.7.15.2) will provide the primaryMACAddress. That can lead to totally wrong results. Prerequisites: SCCM Clients with multiple NICs Reproduction:   *  set Primary mac manually to the one that would not be chosen by the behavior described above  *  Import from sccm  Result: Error Task will be created (ower and ower again, which is also not good). Primary MAC is overwritten. Expected Result: Rework the Evaluation to a more logical process. Maybe ask the empirum guys about how they calculate it, because somehow they do."

Luckily in current versions it is not possible to add virtual machines to \"System Restriction\" because they are filtered out. It does happen however that older license inventory records contain virtual machines or that for some reason a computer recordd was changed to a virtual machine after the license was created (see reproduction). Of course such scenarios do not make sense from a business perspective, but these things do happen and cause disruption on a larger scale. Impact: Can be severe for OEM License inventory records with many usage rights. Prerequisites: None Reproduction:   *  Create an OEM License with 10 usage rights and add 10 computers to \"System Restriction\"  *  Save license and check that it is correctly validated  *  Open one of the computers under \"System Restriction\", fill in the field \"Host Computer\" to turn it into a virtual machine and save computer  *  Refresh OEM License   Result: Validation fails for entire license record. All usage rights are invalid. Validation: Failed - Computers Not Assigned Or Not Relevant Expected Result: Validation is successful. 9 usage rights are still valid and only one usage right is invalid. Workaround: None."

This does not occur if the action \"Import\" is executed from an already existing record or from the search page, so the error is most likely related to the action trying to find some kind of object context but cannot find the object because it has not been created yet. Since the GDIE, that is being triggered by this action, has no contextual connection to individual records, the fact that such a record does not yet exist, should not cause this error. Impact: No business impact and confusing at the most.

  "Repro Steps": "Created by: Hauner, Oliver Category:  Build: 8.0.2.1580 - WPM2015 Update 2 Symptoms: Empirum Connector flaggs all software as uninstalled when the Computer record in Empirum has been deleted. Since the license relevant asset status can already be managed with Management Type = Empirum there is no necessety to remove installation records from the Computer record in Service Store. It may very well be even desired to preserve the software inventory in Service Store for the following reasons: in the \"classical\" asset management lifecycle process you will want to freeze the current state of the computer as is, when it is scrapped. That includes its software inventory. in some scenarios it may not be possible to physically manage the computers with Empirum, so they are inventorised once, the software inventory used in Service Store and the Computer record in Empirum is no longer required. The existence of Service Store's software inventory should not depend on the existence of a corresponding Empirum record. Issue has been discussed with Torsten Boch, who agrees that the current behaviour is a bug. Impact: Low Prerequisites: None Reproduction:   *  Inventorise a computer with Empirum Inventory or import an inventory file to Emp.Inv  *  Run Empirum Connector and check that the computer was imported and check if there are records in \"Inv. Applications\"  *  Delete the computer from Empirum and run Empirum Connector again  *  Check \"Inv. Applications\" in the Computer record in Service Store   Result: All installation records are flagged as uninstalled. Expected Result: All installation records remain flagged as installed. Installations should only be flagged as uninstalled, if the inventory source (Empirum record) still exists and the installation is no longer present there. Workaround: Do not delete Empirum record."

Editing of existing Computers seems to be denied correctly.  Expected Result: If in role Everyone the permissions for objects is set to deny for create and delete, it shouldn't be possible to create and delete objects.   Additional Information: Permissions \"deny\" for create and delete work correctly until Version 8.1.1 (tested).  I tested set pemissions not only for deny but with unchecking permissions in User Roles too for Create and Delete. Here in Version 8.1.2 it doens't apply correctly too. If You remove these permissions for Create and Delete, You still can delete and create objects.  Whole permission concept for \"set permissions\" in user roles has to be reworked!"

After that, to use the new Sync on Agent workflow, the customer has to create a new sync workflow, where the new sync on agent workflow is selected. And finaly all compliance rules, which trigger sync workflow, must be customized, to add the new created workflow in action section. Please keep in mind, that if we are going to rework something in this area, no customer, who doesn't want Accountname as displaystring in their active directory, will not get these updates without some work on rollback and customize again. It is the same discussion as we had with \"import additional attributes\", which is already great implement.  Prerequisites: - Reproduction:   *  -  Result: - Expected Result: There should be again a drop down men� where you can select some logical combinations or the implementation is similar to the existing \"import additional attributes\" feature, meaning customer can add the AD Attribute Name which should be used for syncing back the display name."

  "Repro Steps": "Created by: Hauner, Oliver Category: PRB-520.11 Build: 8.0.2.1580 - WPM2015 Update 2 Symptoms: It is not possible to use Additional Services for Installation, Repair and Uninstallation Charges in conjunction with custom pricing set in catalogs. Impact: Essential requirement in large enterprises. Prerequisites: None Reproduction: In a service A set Installation Charge to \"Additional Service\" and add a service B In \"Catalog\" define a catalog and set a custom price Order service A in portal Result:   *  In the services overview service A is marked to require an installation service  *  When adding the service to the cart a message warns that service B will be added to the cart  *  The shopping cart summary shows only service A and not service B  *  After submitting the order, only service A is booked  So to summarise: before and while adding to cart, the Additional Service from the default pricing is used, but after adding to cart the settings of the catalog's custom pricing are applied, which excludes the Additional Service. This is inconsistent and needs to be fixed. Essentially the behaviour is, that custom pricing overrides default pricing, which in itself is OK. However it is not possible to set Additional Services within the custom pricing  Expected Result: 1. Consistent behaviour (don't use any settings from default pricing when custom pricing applies). 2. Options to add Additional Services to the custom price settings for a catalog   Workaround: None"

And because of the the days past since last used are simply wrong for some customer cases. I will describe the 2 cases and give you the server credentials. I have a running system with customer production and staging database. Case in our system see tmp screenshots: I have executed 2 imports and it seems that the last usage time value sometimes changes. I delete all entrys from SPSApplicationClassUsage, run empirum import. as you see in TMP850A and TMP4F15 the lastusage in service store has changed.

  "Title": "PRB28705: Empirum Connector must import the domain of the user executing Empirum Inventory and use it to match the account in Inv.Logins",
  "Repro Steps": "Created by: Hauner, Oliver Category:  Build: 8.0.2.1580 - WPM2015 Update 2 Symptoms: Empirum Connector does import domain information of user account that performed inventory of a computer. Current behaviour is a workaround introduced with PRB27019 - Inventory Scans in trusted domain scenarios will not be listed in Service Store because the matching user account will only be searched in the domain the computer is a member of If however the same user account login name exists in multiple domains, this workaround will fail.  Currently Empirum does not provide the domain of the inventorising user, but only the domain, the computer is a member of. Currently Empirum development is working on a change that will provide this information in future Empirum versions. Empirum Connector must import this information and use it for matching with the correct user account. The details on how Empirum will fix this are required for fixing it on the Service Store side. Please keep in touch with Torsten Boch and Horst Dr�ge for further details.  Impact: Severe - some customers have domain migration scenarios where exactly this situation (same user account login name exists in multiple domains) occurs. Result is that Inv. Logins remains empty and the automated principal user assignment does not work. Please note: THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE OF PRB27019, it is the second step to fixing the underlying issue properly. Prerequisites:   *  A computer in domain A, a user account in domain A and domain B. Both accounts need to have identical login names.   *  Domains A and B need a trust, so that user accounts from domain B can log onto the computer.  *  Inventory needs to be executed on the computer using the user's credentials.  *  Service Store's AD Connector / LDAP Data Provider imports users from domains A and B.  Reproduction:   *  Log into computer with user account from trusted domain B  *  Check in Empirum that the computer has been inventorised correctly  *  Run Empirum Connector and check the computer record in Service Store   Result: Unknown (not tested). It will be either: 1. User account in domain A is displayed or 2. Scan is not listed under \"Inv. Logins\" because of ambiguous match.  Expected Result: Empirum Connector records the login with domain\\user and can match precisely Workaround: None"

Impact: High  Prerequisites: Soft- and hardware inventory from Windows Inventory (and optionally VMWware Inventory)  Reproduction (extreme example):   *  Find license demand with Quantity > 1 (e.g. MATRIX42, Workplace Management Suite non-specific with license model \"Managed Nodes\" or \"MATRIX42 Devices\" - could have high quantities like \"100\") We assume we have e.g. 4 such LRQ records.  *  In this Software Product modify downgrades: add Microsoft, Windows Server DataCenter 2012 R2 to \"License Downgrade From\" and add its default license model \"Windows Standard 2012 | 2 CPU + CAL (Ltd.

Result: Scenario A: Nothing happens, because the 10 available usage rights are not near sufficient to cover 4x100 requested usage rights.  Scenario B: If the license has 100 usage rights (2CPU...), only one license demand with 100 usage rights (Managed Nodes) will change license model and will be licensed. After LCM Batch Processing has completed, the number of required usage rights will be reduced to 1 (assuming the consumer has 1 or 2 CPUs), the other license demands will not change license model.  Expected Result: System logic first checks if licenses are available up the downgrade chain, then calulates the number of required usage rights using the metric of the license and then checks if sufficient usage rights are availabe.  Recalculation of quantity should take place immediately (just like with manual license model change) and not with batch processing.

  "Repro Steps": "Created by: Hajzyk, Peter Category: Matrix42 Service Store 5.x SCCM Connector [PRB] Build: 8.1.0.1651 - WPM 8.1 SCCM API call has to be adjusted.  After Team Pluto investigated SCCM Installation and uninstallation issues the following info has been provided from Juergen Ackers: Hi Guys,  I have investigated the problem � and sadly I have to say, that the solution which Markus proposed (Some worker thread, that is working on a queue and which is triggered by an Event) does not work well, because the current implementation of Service Store seems to rely on the return value of the Connector Method (which is the Assignment ID of the deployed Application). It would be some difficult task to synchronize that usages correctly.  So I did a deeper look on the Service Store implementation and some things catched my eye:  (a)    The SCCM connector seems to be used via the singleton template � i.e. there is only one instance of our Connector doing all the stuff  See class HeliumFactory: Declaration private static SCCM2012SoftwareDistributionsHandler _newApiHelper;  Creation inside of Method GetApiHelper() if (_newApiHelper == null) {       _newApiHelper = new SCCM2012SoftwareDistributionsHandler(); } _newApiHelper.Initialize(_server, _user, _password); return _newApiHelper;  (b)   There is a lock object named ProvisioningLock existing in class SCCM2012SoftwareDistributionsHandler, but� it is used only in Method CreateAppDistribution(). Every other public method which uses the _connectionManager object does not cover that use with that lock. In my eyes that is a major flaw, because on every use there is a sequence of opening and closing the connection, which internally disposes the WqlConnectionManager object, which does the real WMI working stuff inside our Connector. So the connector state will be undefined when another of class SCCM2012SoftwareDistributionsHandler is used while the application is distributed.  (c)    The main difference between SCCM package distribution and SCCM application distribution by Services Store is: package distribution uses the connector�s high level method API_Wmi.CreateSwDistribution()whereas the application distribution does not use API_Wmi.CreateAppDistribution() but uses several low level (or step-by-step) methods (GetFolderId(), GetCollectionId(),RemoveCollectionDirectMembers(), CreateCollection(), CreateAppDeployment(), MoveItemToFolder() and  GetAppDeploymentId()) � that exposes a similar problem as (b) above inside our connector � there is a lock inside the connector, but it only covers two methods � guess which ones� exactly CreateSwDistribution() and CreateAppDistribution().  So I think, we have found the reason, why there never is a problem with package distribution, but only with application distribution.  As a solution here are some proposals from our side:  �         Removal of the singleton template would be a good first try � Just return a fresh SCCM2012SoftwareDistributionsHandler object on every call of HeliumFactory.GetApiHelper().  �         If that singleton is for some reason needed and cannot be removed, then it is mandatory, that EVERY class, that uses  that singleton object has to lock that usage with a COMMON lock object (i.e. only one lock for ALL classes) in EVERY public method. Not in just one method, as it is done now.  �         Perhaps think about the reasons why Service Store does not use the high level application distribution method � perhaps it would be more secure to have the connector itself do all the SCCM tricks, as it is done for SCCM packages.  Regards J�rgen Ackers"

Impact: Serious for customers trying to identify unused applications. The search results and the report become meaningless.

  "Title": "PRB29191: Silverback Data Provider is case sensitive on importing Mobile Apps",
  "Repro Steps": "Created by: Hauner, Oliver Category:  Build: 8.0.2.1580 - WPM2015 Update 2 Symptoms: Silverback Data Provider is case sensitive on importing Mobile Apps. The XML file \"Mobile Apps.xml\" contains 2 entries for the same app and version. The difference is: one of them contains the name only in small letters, the other in capital letters at the beginning of each word. Example:  Identifier:[microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_8wekyb3d8bbwe]; Name:[microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps]; Version:[2015.7369.40798.0]; Identifier:[microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_8wekyb3d8bbwe]; Name:[Microsoft.WindowsCommunicationsApps]; Version:[2015.7369.40798.0]; Inspite of the same app and version number both variations have actually been found on different devices (see \"Mobile Device Apps.xml\"). Both versions are then imported as separate Fingerprints by \"MDM: Import Installed Silverback Applications\". The next GDI sequence \"MDM: Import Silverback Device Applications\" fails with ambiguous matches, because the matching process is NOT case sensitive. So either the Workflow step that creates the XML or the GDI that imports the fingerprints (\"MDM: Import Installed Silverback Applications\") should eliminate the duplicate. Impact: Import fails on last step. Prerequisites: Silverback installation with enrolled Windows Phone devices that contain the same version of Microsoft's communications apps (Outlook and calendar), as well as the above differences in naming (small vs capital letters). Reproduction: Run Silverback import if the environment meets the above prerequisites (highly unlikely) or analyse the issue with the attached xml files. Result: \"MDM: Import Installed Silverback Applications\" imports the above app as 2 separate Fingerprints and therefore \"MDM: Import Silverback Device Applications\" cannot match the installation entries to a unique Fingerprint and fails with ambiguous match. Expected Result: \"MDM: Import Installed Silverback Applications\" handles the upper- and lower case difference, imports only one Fingerprint and therefore \"MDM: Import Silverback Device Applications\" correctly matches the installation entries to a unique Fingerprint and runs successfully. Workaround: None."

Required data: Recipient, Cost Center Please define the required information and proceed. The same happens if you remove the Recipient with Backspace Key until the field is empty and click to somewhere else in the web page. Impact: Mainly cosmetic due to Workaround. However it is possible that the user can get caught in a loop. This specific worst-case-scenario will be described in a separate section. Prerequisites: None Reproduction:   *  Go to Self Service Portal > Catalog  *  Option 1: click on the \"x\" behind the name of the recipient  *  Option 2: Click behind the name and press Backspace key until name is removed (you may have to click somewhere on the web page right after)  Result: The following error message appears: The service recipient is mandatory for ordering services. Required data: Recipient, Cost Center Please define the required information and proceed. Expected Result: The error message should not appear.

With that on an update or system check > publish dialogs, the schema from database is written to ascx file. This schema is quite old and is not equal to the one provided by an update. It is easy to solve for us, but as soon as the journal is not correct every activity can not be opened. This issue is everytime severty 1 for customers, who are using the service desk. I don't know, what the customers are doing to set this flag to 1, but I'm pretty sure that some action in our GUI is the reason. Before we start searching, it is may be easier to simply save the correct schema for journal and attachment ascx in database, like for every other dialog. Prerequisites: To see the problem simply execute the script: (Please note, this script is only for reproduction, customer are somehow setting this flag unintentional over the UI) update SPSContentClassObjectDialogTabset IsGenerated = 1where ContentUserControl like '%journal%' and IsGenerated = 0 Reproduction:   *  execute script above  *  perform update or run system check in configizward while \"publish forms\" is active.  *  open incident dialog  Result: journal.ascx size is 1kb. activity objects can not be opened Expected Result: 2 options: Find out in code, which action can trigger this flag or Simply store schema for journal and attachments ascx in database."

This behavior will stay until the import was \"new saved\" by running action \"edit importdefinition\". Then it will import all rows again until the importdefinition is executed as quick import over the action with internal name \"GDIE_ImportType\" another time. This action executes import definitions, which are marked as quick import, in quick import mode. Maybe this happens, because I am trying to import an N : m relation and quick import for some reason ignores this. Please see the video attached, it shows configuration and testscenario of an example case. In my example I simply import 5 users as attachedusers to an specific task. To do so I prepared an excel sheet which provides 5 ID's from SPSuserClassbase and a static ticketnumber.

Customer also mentioned that he gets this error with a debugger von clicking on add to cart: SCRIPT5007: Unable to get property 'ContextAggregator' of undefined or null reference File: DialogContentContainer.aspx, Line: 76, Column: 189 Code: $(function(){top.Matrix42.ContextAggregator.publish(new top.Matrix42.ActionPanelContext({showActions:true}))}) Maybe it is related maybe not. Prerequisites: customer system Reproduction:   *  order a service with a custom form  Result: Everytime when this error happens you may find this in console log 2015-10-22 08:09:44,805 ERROR 75 Console (null) (null) (null)  (null) 8.0.2.1580   - Service (SPSArticleClassBase.ID = 063e074b-443a-e311-d68d-0050568f49e2) was not added to the shopping cart because it is reference to the custom form (SPSCommonClassBase.ID = 93541dec-9378-e511-f0ad-0050568f4a19) used by another shopping cart item Expected Result: No error with correct configuration.  Additional Information by Heiko Fischer The file \"\\Matrix42 Service Store\\Web\\Portal\\UserControls\\FillCustomForm.js\" may access the value \"customFormFrame.contentWindow.SpsObjectModifiedID\" inside the function \"SubmitCompleted(frameid)\" although it is not initialized and set. I guess this happens, when inside the function \"CheckSaved(firstCall, frameId)\" the IFrame starts loading (variable \"frame\" is not null) but the loading has not yet reached the point where this variable is set. As this seems to be a parallel race condition issue, it appeared only sometimes. My solution for this: only enter SubmitCompleted function when the frame finished loading (), to make sure the variable is there. So please check and finally adopt this code into the product: function CheckSaved(firstCall, frameId) {     var REFRESH_TIMEOUT = 50;       var frame = GetPropertyPage(frameId);     if (frame != null)     {         if (frame.contentWindow.g_FiredObjectEvent == \"Applying\") // iframe was saved         {             inProgress = null;       if (frame.readyState == \"complete\" || frame.isLoaded) // this should solve T117200 / PRB28177    {     SubmitCompleted(frameId);     popupSSP.hide({ButtonTag:update4u.Popups.ButtonTags.Submit});     popupSSP = null;    }    else    {     //wait for frame to finish loading, so \"customFormFrame.contentWindow.SpsObjectModifiedID\" inside mehtod \"SubmitCompleted\" is available     setTimeout(function () { CheckSaved(false, frameId); }, REFRESH_TIMEOUT);    }         }         else          { ...rest stays the same"

  "Repro Steps": "Created by: B�nick, Matthias Category:  Build: 8.0.2.1580 - WPM2015 Update 2 Symptoms: We had a mail robot crash on customer side. See attached hostcommon logs. The reason was an 11,3 mb text mail (no attachments), it seems the the lotus domino server was not able to deliver it completly to our mail robot, or our mail robot was somehow not able to import this mail under 7.0.1.  We also did a debuglog on lotus domino servers, see attach zip file. But debug log from notes only contain informations about the mail, which caused the problem. Because of this logs we removed this mail from inbox, restarted everything, mail robot starts to import everyhting again. The customer has about 60-70 inboxes, next time it's mabye not that easy to find the mail, because of this we need a timeout for mail robot. As example: Mail robot is not able to retrive the full mail within 20 seconds > abort the process mark the mail as read and add comment in hostcommon.log and continue with next mail. I tested the same with google mail mailbox, but was not able to reproduce this issue under 8.0.2. The mail was imported within 10 seconds. So this change is maybe only important to deny the possiblity of mail robot outage for our lotus domino customers. Prerequisites: lotus domino server Reproduction:   *  create a mail which contains 11mb + pure text, no attachments  *  import this mail with mailrobot  Result: On customer site: Mail robots never finishes processing this mail (lotus domino), in our lab with google mail: 10 seconds processing time. Expected Result: For the lotus domino system, a timeout should be present like mentioned in description. (Mail robot is not able to retrive the full mail within 20 seconds > abort the process mark the mail as read and add comment in hostcommon.log and continue with next mail.)"

It should read out a pickup table of the CustomForm and if HR Role is selected (see Step-1_BookingInput.jpg)  it should create one approval step for the legal manager of the consumer and after that a second approval with static approver. If HR Role is not selected it should create only the LM approval step. See process in Step-3_Approval_Workflow_Setup.jpg. As the first step is for both ways in the workflow a LM approval both tasks will end up at the same person.  Scenario: A user creates two bookings for this service in the same order (Step-1_OrderCreation.jpg). In the first booking he selects not the HR Role in the pickup but in the second booking he selects the HR Role (see Step-1_BookingInput.jpg).  The approval is correctly routed to the legal manager of the customer and the legal manager can approve (see Step-2_Approval.jpg). After approving both legal manager approval steps are shown as approved but the workflow still shows status suspended. No second approval step is generated.  If the booking creation is done the other way around: First in the custom form selection of \"HR Role\" and secondly no HR role the workflow works as expected. (See screenshot CorrectBehavior.jpg which shows the status after the legal manager has approved the order) Result: Workflow stays 'suspendet' even though there is no open approval Task. Expected Result: Approval Tasks and workflow instance are processed correctly."

Prerequisites: App and SQL Server with different time settings. App Server should 5 minutes in the \"future\".

The point that i can happen is very low. In numbers we had 2 customers till now, one of these has still this problem, because his appserver still runs \"faster\" than all others server, even after they corrected it and enabled timesetting sync with AD Server. (Same for SQL.) Maybe simply exchange the get data, which returns workflow starttime, with an executeSQL, where you take execute an getdate.

In a specific customer environment which was updated from previous versions this CoRu, including a few others was \"damaged\", resulting in the described behaviour. SPSComplianceRuleActions shows multiple entries for these CoRus, but in the UI not a single action is visible. In some cases (not all) the LCID is overwritten.

In the last weeks some customers reported \"issues\" that their group sync workflows do not work. After investigation we recognized that these workflows where started everytime after the provisioning workflow added an user to group. This workflow starts are not needed, because the old provisioning workflows does it all alone. The start of the sync workflows afterwards should be avoided.

  "Title": "PRB28306: License Depreciation calculation allows Current Book Value to exceed Purchase Price",
  "Repro Steps": "Created by: Hauner, Oliver Category: PRB-520.06 Build: 8.0.2.1580 - WPM2015 Update 2 Symptoms: License depreciation is calculated incorrectly, when Purchasing date is in the second half of the current year. According to German tax laws, only half of the annual depriciation can be applied if an asset (in this case a license) is purchased within the second half of the year. Example: license inventory worth 40.000 EUR is purchased and depreciated over a 4 year period. This means: annual depreciation (to be applied at end of the year only) is 10.000 EUR. If however the asset is purchased after June 30 (second half of the year), depreciation will be only 5.000 EUR for the first year, 10.00 for the next 3 and the remaining 5.000 for the last. The currently implemented JScript has the following issue: in this example the current value goes up by 5.000 EUR (which should never happen. The current book value is never higher than the purchase price), to go down by 10.000 EUR at the end of the year. Impact: unknown Prerequisites: Data of reproduction before 2016-01-01. If it is reproduced later, then the first depreciation will have already been applied and the numbers will seem correct. Reproduction (this requires the current date being before 2016-01-01): Open a license and go to dialog \"Depreciation\" Set purchasing date to e.g. 2015-10-01, Depreciation Period = 4 years, Purchasing price = 40.000 EUR Check current Book Value  Result: Book Value is 45.000 EUR Expected Result: Book Value is 40.000 EUR. Workaround: Modification of JScript for Depreciation dialog. From PSO we received the following modification (tested by support and seems to work fine): function RecalculateBookValue() {     var anualDepreciation = roundNumber(igedit_getById(\"<%=SPSAssetClassBaseAnnualAmortizationValue.WebCurrencyEdit.ClientID%>\").getValue(), 2);     var bookCtrl = igedit_getById('<%=SPSAssetClassBaseBookValue.WebCurrencyEdit.ClientID%>');     var unitPrice = igedit_getById(\"<%=SPSAssetClassOrderInvoiceUnitPrice.WebCurrencyEdit.ClientID%>\").getValue();     var bookValue = 0;     if (StartDateContr.getValue() != null && parseFloat(anualDepreciation) && parseFloat(anualDepreciation) > 0)      {         var purchaseMounth = StartDateContr.getValue().getMonth() + 1;         var purchaseYear = StartDateContr.getValue().getFullYear();         var currentDate = new Date();         var currentYear = currentDate.getFullYear();         if (EndDateContr.getValue() < currentDate)          {             bookValue = 0;         }          else         {                          if (purchaseYear >=currentYear)                {                 bookValue = unitPrice;             }              else             {                if (purchaseMounth >= 1 && purchaseMounth <= 6)                 {                   bookValue = unitPrice - (currentYear - purchaseYear) * anualDepreciation;                }                else                 {                   bookValue = unitPrice - ((currentYear - purchaseYear) * 2 - 1) * (anualDepreciation / 2);                }             }         }     }     bookCtrl.setValue(roundNumber(bookValue, 2)); }"

The incident has no Initiator and no responsible Person when it was created by Portal or Mail. When the paused ticket will be reactivated the Person who paused the incident will be set as responsible and the state will be changed to \"In Progress\" - but the Initiator will not be set. From now on the responsible can work with the incident and will use Actions which will not set the Initiator (comment, send E-Mail, pause ticket). Prerequisites: Incident which was created by Portal user or e-mail Reproduction:   *  Log in console  *  Switch to working tab \"Service Desk\"  *  Open \"Incidents\"  *  Select and open Incident (which was created by Portal user or mail)  *  Use Action \"Pause\"  *  Wait until Service \"Escalation Manager\" will reactivate the incident  *  Check State, Responsible and Initiator  Result: State will be changed to \"In Progress\". Responsible will be set to Person who paused the incident. Initiator is still empty Expected Result: As discussed with Karin Schmidt, the Action \"Pause\" has to be not allowed for tickets in state \"new\".

For Eastern time zones (UTC+x) the date will be converted to one day earlier. Example: Example: Christmas Eve 24.12.2015 00:00:00 will be converted to 23.12.2015 23:00:00 and be incorrectly stored as 23.12.2015. The search grid will show the correct date 24.12.2015 which however is not true - 23.12.2015 is stored in the database and the escalation rules will apply to this. The grid therefore gives a false impression and it is often unnoticed that the holidays are incorrect. Impact: Tickets can escalate on holidays and do not escalate a day before. Customer will often not notice that they have incorrect holidays because the grid gives a false impression of correctness as it shows the correct dates. Due to this there might not be very many related incidents, nevertheless the issue can be quite serious. Prerequisites: None Reproduction: Use the import sequence \"Import Holidays\", enter a few holidays into the Excel template and import Use a time zone UTC+x; (x > 0)  Result: Imported holidays are imported as dd.MM.YYYY - 1d Expected Result: Imported holidays are imported as dd-1.MM.YYYY Workaround: In import wizard select a time zone UTC-x; (x > 0).

When an import sequence has mappings to a pickup table's display string attribute the matching will fail when the Country Setting differs from the Server's OS language. If however the GDI is started from Administration > Import Definitions using the Action \"Execute Import Defition\" the Country Setting will be used and the mapping works. Impact: Import definitions with mappings to display strings in pickup tables will finish with partial success or will remove values. This is especially critical when the above applies to the status of an object. Prerequisites: Check language of Server OS and set Country Setting of import definition to something different. For simplification of the problem description we will assume the Server OS is English and we will choose \"German (Germany)\" as the GDI's Country Setting. Reproduction:   *  Edit the out-of-the-box Import Sequence \"Import Cost Centers\" to use the attached file as import source  *  Set Country Setting to \"German (Germany)\"  *  Save import sequence and run it from action \"Execute Import Definition\" (Result will be an imported Cost Center with Status=\"Active\" and Type=\"Department\")  *  Go to Administration > Quick Start > Services > Show All Engine Activations > New and create an Activation with \"Activated Engines\"=\"GDIE Import\".

With that the customer has to check for changes in everyupdate, because of an minor change in the workflow. In addition after an update no customer thinks that we removed an feature and will may be suprised by the usage of account names for AD Attribute \"Name\". We had this problem as bug escalation hat PxC last year, but it seems nothing has changed till now. Please add the naming schema functionality like it was present before 7.2 There are many customers who are currently using Accountname as \"Name\" in AD, but also customer who are using displaystring as Name. (This AD Attribute is used as displaystring in AD User Management GUI) So this can't be solved by simply changing the standard.

The wizard recreate the 443 binding (after this error I checked SSL Binding and it has no certificate anymore.) Solution/workaround from OPO, please forward to him. He knows reproduction steps. I've reproduced this problem on test environment. The problem is that Configurations get domain certificate from Root and then tries write it in the bindings for Default Web Site. But there are used Personal certificates. And It fails to write it and on the next step when SSL Force options is set, binding do not have defined certificate and it fails with exception \"Force SSL option could not be set if https binding was not defined for site Default Web Site\". So this is a bug in Configuration/Setup wizard. (bug needs to be created) As a workaround you could try to remove this certificate from Local location. And then run wizard again but choose \"Use Self Signed SSL Certificate\" option (actually it should be selected automatically). Wizard should pass. After this you can delete this Self Signed Certificate, install again local and use it in IIS in bindings."

  "Title": "PRB28746: Deleted obsolete duplicates of vendors are reimported by full LIS Update after deleting in Service Store",
  "Repro Steps": "Created by: Hauner, Oliver Category: PRB-520.06 Build: 8.0.2.1580 - WPM2015 Update 2 Symptoms: Deleted vendors in LIS data keep getting reimported into Service Store for no obvious reason. Several obsolete vendor records (duplicates of existing vendors) had been deleted from LIS data more than a year ago but are still imported into Service Store by LIS update, even though no Software Products are related to them. Impact: Due to the duplicate vendors the SCCM data provider fails to match the vendor when checking for stock keeping units and keeps creating the same record several times. Prerequisites: None Reproduction: Run the following query in SQL Server Management Studio on M42Production DB: select m.ShortName, m.Name, m.Obsolete, m.SourceID from SPSSupplierClassBase m left join SPSStockKeepingUnitClassBase s on s.Manufacturer = m.ID left join SPSAssetClassBase a on a.Supplier = m.ID left join LISSoftwareProductClassBase l on l.Publisher = m.ID where m.ShortName in (select ShortName from SPSSupplierClassBase group by ShortName having count (ShortName) > 1) and m.SourceID is not null  --and m.IsManufacturer = '1' --and s.Manufacturer is null --and a.supplier is null and l.Publisher is null and m.obsolete = '1' order by m.ShortName This shows all obsolete duplicates of existing vendors with the same ShortName and no associated Software Product in LIS. The following script deletes these: begin transaction Delete from SPSSupplierClassBase where ID in ( select m.ID from SPSSupplierClassBase m left join SPSStockKeepingUnitClassBase s on s.Manufacturer = m.ID left join SPSAssetClassBase a on a.Supplier = m.ID left join LISSoftwareProductClassBase l on l.Publisher = m.ID where m.ShortName in (select ShortName from SPSSupplierClassBase group by ShortName having count (ShortName) > 1) --and m.SourceID is not null  --and m.IsManufacturer = '1' and m.Obsolete = '1' --and s.Manufacturer is null --and a.supplier is null and l.Publisher is null ) commit transaction Run incremental LIS Update and check again with the above query Run full LIS Update and check again with the above query  Result: Incremental LIS Update runs without GDI errors and the duplicates remain gone. The query shows 0 results. After full LIS Update the duplicates have returned.  Expected Result: Obsolete vendors remain deleted. Workaround: None"
